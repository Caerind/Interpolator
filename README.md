# Interpolator

A small program to interpolate function.

It uses my small library about Graph and Functions with SFML.

The interpolation method used is [Lagrange Interpolating Polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_polynomial), see the [Lagrange.hpp](https://github.com/Cmdu76/Interpolator/blob/master/Lagrange.hpp) for details.
